 # RoboRally 
by MACROHARD

This is a digital remake of the classic board game RoboRally.


## Known bugs
- Currently throws "WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred", 
when the Java version used is less than 8. This has no effect on function or performance, and is just a warning.

- Players with their Archive marker on an occupied Tile will reboot on that tile. They will not be able to
choose any of the adjacent tiles as a place for their reboot.

## Build instruction
To run application, clone the repository as a Maven-project and run the main()-method in 'RoboRallyApplication.java'.
